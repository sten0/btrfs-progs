Convention and style used for manual pages
------------------------------------------

Manual pages structure:

- add references to all external commands mentioned anywhere in the text to the
  'SEE ALSO' section
  - also add related, not explicitly mentioned
- the heading levels are validated
  - mandatory, manual page ===
  - mandatory, sections ---
  - optional, sub-sections ~~~
- command-specific examples are mostly free of restrictions but should be
  readable in all output formats (manual page, html)

- subcommands are in alphabetical order

- long command output or shell examples: verbatim output
  - a new paragraph, 2 spaces at the beginning of the line, or the comment block

Quotation in subcommands:

- exact syntax: monotype `usage=0`
- reference to arguments etc: 'italics'
- command reference: bold *btrfs filesystem show*
  - subcommand names should be spelled in full, ie. 'filesystem' instead of 'fi'
- section references: italics 'EXAMPLES'

- argument name in option description: caps in angle brackets <NAME>
  - reference in help text: caps NAME
    also possible: caps italics 'NAME'

- command short description:
  - command name: bold *command*
  - optional unspecified: brackets [options]
  - mandatory argument: angle brackets <path>
  - optional parameter with argument: [-p <path>]

Other:

- NOTE: at the beginning of the line, is rendered as a separate paragraph and
  should be used only for important information

- WARNING: at the beginning of the line, is rendered as a separate paragraph
  and most likely more visible than NOTE, use for critical information that
  may cause harm, irreversible state or performance problems
  - should point reader to other part of documentation to seek more details
