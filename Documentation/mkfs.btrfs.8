.SH "NAME"
mkfs.btrfs \- create a btrfs filesystem
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBmkfs\&.btrfs\fR [options] \fI<device>\fR [\fI<device>\fR\&...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBmkfs\&.btrfs\fR is used to create the btrfs filesystem on a single or multiple devices\&. \fI<device>\fR is typically a block device but can be a file\-backed image as well\&. Multiple devices are grouped by UUID of the filesystem\&.
.sp
Before mounting such filesystem, the kernel module must know all the devices either via preceding execution of \fBbtrfs device scan\fR or using the \fBdevice\fR mount option\&. See section \fBMULTIPLE DEVICES\fR for more details\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-b|\-\-byte\-count \fR\fB\fI<size>\fR\fR
.RS 4
Specify the size of the filesystem\&. If this option is not used, then mkfs\&.btrfs uses the entire device space for the filesystem\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-d|\-\-data \fR\fB\fI<profile>\fR\fR
.RS 4
Specify the profile for the data block groups\&. Valid values are
\fIraid0\fR,
\fIraid1\fR,
\fIraid5\fR,
\fIraid6\fR,
\fIraid10\fR
or
\fIsingle\fR
or dup (case does not matter)\&.
.sp
See
\fIDUP PROFILES ON A SINGLE DEVICE\fR
for more\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-m|\-\-metadata \fR\fB\fI<profile>\fR\fR
.RS 4
Specify the profile for the metadata block groups\&. Valid values are
\fIraid0\fR,
\fIraid1\fR,
\fIraid5\fR,
\fIraid6\fR,
\fIraid10\fR,
\fIsingle\fR
or
\fIdup\fR, (case does not matter)\&.
.sp
A single device filesystem will default to
\fIDUP\fR, unless a SSD is detected\&. Then it will default to
\fIsingle\fR\&. The detection is based on the value of
\fB/sys/block/DEV/queue/rotational\fR, where
\fIDEV\fR
is the short name of the device\&.
.sp
Note that the rotational status can be arbitrarily set by the underlying block device driver and may not reflect the true status (network block device, memory\-backed SCSI devices etc)\&. Use the options
\fI\-\-data/\-\-metadata\fR
to avoid confusion\&.
.sp
See
\fIDUP PROFILES ON A SINGLE DEVICE\fR
for more details\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-M|\-\-mixed\fR
.RS 4
Normally the data and metadata block groups are isolated\&. The
\fImixed\fR
mode will remove the isolation and store both types in the same block group type\&. This helps to utilize the free space regardless of the purpose and is suitable for small devices\&. The separate allocation of block groups leads to a situation where the space is reserved for the other block group type, is not available for allocation and can lead to ENOSPC state\&.
.sp
The recommended size for the mixed mode is for filesystems less than 1GiB\&. The soft recommendation is to use it for filesystems smaller than 5GiB\&. The mixed mode may lead to degraded performance on larger filesystems, but is otherwise usable, even on multiple devices\&.
.sp
The
\fInodesize\fR
and
\fIsectorsize\fR
must be equal, and the block group types must match\&.

versions up to 4\&.2\&.x forced the mixed mode for devices smaller than 1GiB\&. This has been removed in 4\&.3+ as it caused some usability issues\&.

Alias for \-\-nodesize\&. Deprecated\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-n|\-\-nodesize \fR\fB\fI<size>\fR\fR
.RS 4
Specify the nodesize, the tree block size in which btrfs stores metadata\&. The default value is 16KiB (16384) or the page size, whichever is bigger\&. Must be a multiple of the sectorsize and a power of 2, but not larger than 64KiB (65536)\&. Leafsize always equals nodesize and the options are aliases\&.
.sp
Smaller node size increases fragmentation but leads to taller b\-trees which in turn leads to lower locking contention\&. Higher node sizes give better packing and less fragmentation at the cost of more expensive memory operations while updating the metadata blocks\&.

\fB\-s|\-\-sectorsize \fR\fB\fI<size>\fR\fR
.RS 4
Specify the sectorsize, the minimum data block allocation unit\&.
.sp
The default value is the page size and is autodetected\&. If the sectorsize differs from the page size, the created filesystem may not be mountable by the kernel\&. Therefore it is not recommended to use this option unless you are going to mount it on a system with the appropriate page size\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-L|\-\-label \fR\fB\fI<string>\fR\fR

Specify a label for the filesystem\&. The

should be less than 256 bytes and must not contain newline characters\&.

\fB\-K|\-\-nodiscard\fR
.RS 4
Do not perform whole device TRIM operation on devices that are capable of that\&. This does not affect discard/trim operation when the filesystem is mounted\&. Please see the mount option

\fB\-r|\-\-rootdir \fR\fB\fI<rootdir>\fR\fR

.RE
.SH "SIZE UNITS"
.sp
The default unit is \fIbyte\fR\&. All size parameters accept suffixes in the 1024 base\&. The recognized suffixes are: \fIk\fR, \fIm\fR, \fIg\fR, \fIt\fR, \fIp\fR, \fIe\fR, both uppercase and lowercase\&.
.SH "MULTIPLE DEVICES"
.sp
Before mounting a multiple device filesystem, the kernel module must know the association of the block devices that are attached to the filesystem UUID\&.
.sp
There is typically no action needed from the user\&. On a system that utilizes a udev\-like daemon, any new block device is automatically registered\&. The rules call \fBbtrfs device scan\fR\&.
.sp
The same command can be used to trigger the device scanning if the btrfs kernel module is reloaded (naturally all previous information about the device registration is lost)\&.
.sp
Another possibility is to use the mount options \fBdevice\fR to specify the list of devices to scan at the time of mount\&.

that this means only scanning, if the devices do not exist in the system, mount will fail anyway\&. This can happen on systems without initramfs/initrd and root partition created with RAID1/10/5/6 profiles\&. The mount action can happen before all block devices are discovered\&. The waiting is usually done on the initramfs/initrd systems\&.

.SH "DUP PROFILES ON A SINGLE DEVICE"
.sp
The mkfs utility will let the user create a filesystem with profiles that write the logical blocks to 2 physical locations\&. Whether there are really 2 physical copies highly depends on the underlying device type\&.
.sp
For example, a SSD drive can remap the blocks internally to a single copy\(emthus deduplicating them\&. This negates the purpose of increased redundancy and just wastes filesystem space without providing the expected level of redundancy\&.
.sp
The duplicated data/metadata may still be useful to statistically improve the chances on a device that might perform some internal optimizations\&. The actual details are not usually disclosed by vendors\&. For example we could expect that not all blocks get deduplicated\&. This will provide a non\-zero probability of recovery compared to a zero chance if the single profile is used\&. The user should make the tradeoff decision\&. The deduplication in SSDs is thought to be widely available so the reason behind the mkfs default is to not give a false sense of redundancy\&.
.sp
As another example, the widely used USB flash or SD cards use a translation layer between the logical and physical view of the device\&. The data lifetime may be affected by frequent plugging\&. The memory cells could get damaged, hopefully not destroying both copies of particular data in case of DUP\&.
.sp
The wear levelling techniques can also lead to reduced redundancy, even if the device does not do any deduplication\&. The controllers may put data written in a short timespan into the same physical storage unit (cell, block etc)\&. In case this unit dies, both copies are lost\&. BTRFS does not add any artificial delay between metadata writes\&.
.sp
The traditional rotational hard drives usually fail at the sector level\&.
.sp
In any case, a device that starts to misbehave and repairs from the DUP copy should be replaced! \fBDUP is not backup\fR\&.
